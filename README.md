# Prediction-with-Multiple-Regression
python Exploratory data analysis 
prediction with multiple regression machine learning model to predit dependent variable
In project, python libraries like pandas and numpy used for data manipulation and data analysis.
python visualisation library like seaborn,matplotlib.pyplot and plotly used.
for machine learning, scikit library is used to creat model for multiple regression.
created and checked multiple model to verify whose r2_score is more closed to 1. So it considered and save model using joblib library.
